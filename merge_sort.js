// faster sorts can improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)


// MERGE SORT: a combination of two things- merging and sorting
// exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
// works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array
