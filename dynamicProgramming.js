// what is dynamic programming?
    //  "A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those
    // subproblems just once, and storing their solutions"
    // an approach for solving some problems 

// overlapping subproblems:
    // small problems that can be reused
